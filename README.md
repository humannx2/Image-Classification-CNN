# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project demonstrates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of cats and dogs. The dataset used for this project is the **Cats vs Dogs** dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it includes steps for data preprocessing, augmentation, model building, training, evaluation, and testing.

## Project Overview

This project classifies images into two categories: **Cat** or **Dog**. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to process and classify images. The CNN architecture includes multiple layers such as convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers to capture relevant features for classification. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and data augmentation is applied to increase model generalization.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **Cats vs Dogs** dataset, which contains labeled images of cats and dogs. It is split into the following categories:
- **Train**: 80% of the dataset used for training.
- **Test**: 20% of the dataset used for evaluation.
